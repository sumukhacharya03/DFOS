Distributed File Orchestration and Synchronization: Multi-Node Data-Transfer-Framework for Linux

**Overview of the Project:**

We designed and implemented a multi-client file transfer system using a client-server model in Python. The server can handle multiple clients simultaneously. The server should allow the clients to upload, download, view, and delete files from a server-side directory, and respond to multiple concurrent requests without crashing or losing data.

**Background**:

Modern file transfer systems, such as FTP(File Transfer Protocol), are widely used for transferring data between clients and servers in networked environments. Such systems need to support various functionalities like user authentication, file uploading, downloading, and secure data management. Additionally, the system must handle multiple clients simultaneously without sacrificing performance or data integrity.
